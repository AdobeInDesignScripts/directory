# InDesign Community Script Project

This repository contains scripts contributed by the InDesign scripting community. These are free scripts and comply with Open Source protocols. 

## Goals

The goal of the InDesign Community Script Project is to make InDesign users aware of the the power of scripting in InDesign and the many free scripts already available. Adobe would like to connect users with the scripting community to explore scripts for sale or to hire a scripter to develop a custom script and improve your workflow. The repository will be useful to individuals trying to learn more about scripting.

## Non-Goals

The repository is not intended to be comprehensive. Adobe may not be aware of scripts or scripters in the market.
